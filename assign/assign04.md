7.2-2, 7.2-3

8.1-4, 8.3-4

Linear sort implementation

*Hints:*

> 7.2-2 - For an array with *equal* elements, consider how the array is *sorted*.
> 
> 7.2-3 - For an array in *decreasing* order, consider which element is selected as the pivot element during each recursive call and where it is placed once PARTITION() completes. Argue that this behavior produces O(*n*<sup>2</sup>) runtime.
> 
> 8.1-4 - (I like these n/k hybrid algorithms) Use an argument similar to the original Θ(n lg n) one in Theorem 8.1 and show that 
>
> lg((k!)<sup>n/k</sup>) = Ω(n lg k) 
>
> using the properties of logs and the fact that lg(k!) = θ(k lg k) and the definition of θ.
>
> 8.3-4 - Consider the *representation* of the integers in a radix other than 10.

**Implementation**

A skeleton project is provided in [CS360\_Sorter\_Count.zip](../assign/src/CS360_Sorter_Count.zip). The zip file contains both a Visual Studio project and a Linux/OSX makefile to compile the code. **Sorter.cpp** contains both utility functions as well as empty sort function stubs - you should not need to modify **main()** or *any* of the utility functions.

> -   For each input size, the program generates a *random* array **D[]**
> -   **D[]** is copied into the array **A[]** *prior* to each sorting function call (such that each sort works on the *same* data sets)
> -   You may wish to uncomment the **print_array()** call after writing each sort to test your code for **n**=16 and **NUM_AVG**=1 to verify the sort is working correctly
> -   Since C++ does not have an **A.length** member variable, I have included a function called **length(A)** which will return the length of the array (which is stored in **A[0]**)
> -   All arrays have been expanded by 1 (with appropriate adjustments to any loops) to agree with the pseudocode from the book where array indices range from **A[1]** -\> **A[n]**
	
*Your Task*
	
Implement the algorithms *as given in the pseudocode below* for counting sort. Insert counter increment statements (note: a **count** global variable is provided), into each sorting function for each *executable* line of *pseudocode* (e.g. count all three lines required to implement a swap as a *single* operation). Use this counter to *empirically* measure the runtime of each sort. Only increment the counter for statements *within* the sorting functions, i.e. do not include any initialization overhead incurred in **main()** or the utility functions. Note that **count** is reset prior to each sort call but the results are stored in a 2D array **counter** which is used to display a table of all results once all the sorts and runs have completed.

Generate runs for 13 input sizes by changing the **\#define MAX\_RUNS** symbolic constant. This will generate data for increasing powers of 2 from 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 to 2<sup>16</sup> = 65536.

The **\#define NUM\_AVG** sets the number of data sets of each size to generate in order to compute an *average* runtime for each size. This value should be set to a reasonable number, e.g. 10, to give a good approximation of the *average* runtime of each sort. Note that the larger the value that is chosen, the longer the program will take to run.

You should generate tables for *two* different input *ranges*

> -   Set **#define MAX_RANGE 32768** (giving elements in the range [1 -> 32768])
> -   Set **#define MAX_RANGE 1024** (giving elements in the range [1 -> 1024])

Once the data for all input sizes and element ranges have been generated, make *meaningful* plots (e.g. using Excel) of the data showing *important* characteristics. In particular:

> -   Plot number of inputs *n* vs. empirical average runtimes as data *points*
> -   Show the *best fit* asymptotic **curve** for **cn + k** appropriate for the sort. Determine an *approximate* value of **c** and **k** to the nearest 0.5 for each sort that fits the actual data relatively well. (Hint: Simply manually choose values for each **c** and plot the corresponding asymptotic curve until it fits the data *reasonably* well, i.e. you do not need to mathematically find the "best-fit" values. Also note the value of **k**.)

**Hint:** To plot **cn + k**, consider making another column in the spreadsheet that computes the values for each empirical input size *n* and then plot that data as connected points without showing the individual data points.

*Counting Sort*

    COUNTING-SORT(A,B,k)
    1  let C[0..k] be a new array
    2  for i = 0 to k
    3     C[i] = 0
    4  for j = 1 to A.length
    5     C[A[j]] = C[A[j]] + 1
    6  // C[i] now contains the number of elements equal to i
    7  for i = 1 to k
    8     C[i] = C[i] + C[i-1]
    9  // C[i] now contains the number of elements less than or equal to i
    10 for j = A.length downto 1
    11    B[C[A[j]]] = A[j]
    12    C[A[j]] = C[A[j]] - 1

**HINTS:**

Function call statements **DO NOT** increment the counter since their runtime is evaluated by the execution of the function.

Return statement **DO NOT** increment the counter.

Loop statements, i.e. **for** and **while**, will execute *one more* time than the statements in the loop body. Hence a counter can be added to a loop as follows

    for (...) {
       count++;
       // Body of loop
    }
    count++;
    
    while (...) {
       count++;
       // Body of loop
    }
    count++;
    
For simple logic constructs, e.g. **if**, **if/else**, a count update can be added after the structure since only one branch will execute depending on the result of the condition

    if (...) {
       // Body of if
    }
    count++;
    
    if (...) {
       // Body of if branch
    } else {
       // Body of else branch
    }
    count++;
    
For chained logical structures, i.e. **if/else if/ else**, there will need to be counters in *each* branch for the *total* number of conditions evaluated since they execute sequentially

    if (...) {
       count++;
       // Body of first if branch
    } else if (...) {
       count += 2;
       // Body of second if branch
    } else if (...) {
       count += 3;
       // Body of third if branch
    } else {
       count += however many if conditions there are
       // Body of else branch
    }
